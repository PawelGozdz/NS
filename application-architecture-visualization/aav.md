# AAV documentation

In this project, we use Application Architecture Visualization (AAV) to document most important application flow visualizations. See [AAV-0001](aav/0001-application-visualizations-adr.md) for details.

If you're creating your first AAV file, take a look at the format that we're using stored in the [template file](aav/TEMPLATE.md) and review other existing documents for reference.

This is a remporary solution.

## Generating new AAV

For now just copy the TEMPLATE and paste manually the data. Also update [README file](aav/README.md)
